## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Netflix is a subscription-based streaming service that allows our members to watch TV shows and movies on an internet-connected device. Depending on your plan, you can also download TV shows and movies to your iOS, Android, or Windows 10 device and watch without an internet connection.

This platform has successfully disrupted the conventional cable TV aspect and has brought great technological innovations such as digital streaming and machine learning. Netflix has been in a market for twenty years as of now and they keep adding on innovative prospects day by day.
